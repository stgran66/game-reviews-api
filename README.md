Welcome to the Indie Gamer Backend API repository. This repository is an essential component of the Indie Gamer project, designed to provide the backend infrastructure for managing and delivering game data for our platform.

## Technologies Used

The Indie Gamer Backend API is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** The backend server is powered by Node.js, providing a robust runtime environment for JavaScript.

- **Express:** Express.js is used to create the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the database to store and manage game data.

- **Mongoose:** Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, simplifying data interactions.
